# Chemical Analysis of Red and White Wine

This project was completed by Caroline Packowski, Gabrielle Sart and Kaitlin Slattert for the 2018 MBA Data BootCamp course. 

**Project Description** 

For our course project, we set out to study how a wine's chemical composition (pH, alcohol, residual sugar, etc.) affects quality.
By examining each of these chemical attributes, then taking those we suspect to have the greatest impact on quality and running correlation, regression and cluster tests, our goal is to confirm which attribute has the greatest impact on quality.
